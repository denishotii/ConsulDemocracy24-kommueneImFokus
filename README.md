## Introduction
Citizen participation is a cornerstone of transparent and effective governance, yet many municipalities face challenges in achieving meaningful engagement. Barriers such as low accessibility to decision-making platforms, limited public awareness, and fragmented understanding of public sentiment hinder inclusive and data-driven decision-making.

The Consul Democracy platform offers a solution by enabling municipalities to involve citizens in city projects, budgeting, and planning. However, the platform's success relies on understanding how effectively it is being used and how engaged the citizens are.

This project addresses the problem by analyzing the platform’s content and usage patterns. It provides municipalities with actionable insights to improve project proposals, better involve residents, and understand public sentiment. Ultimately, this analysis benefits both governing bodies and citizens by fostering a more participatory and informed approach to civic decision-making.
