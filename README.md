## Introduction
Citizen participation is a cornerstone of transparent and effective governance, yet many municipalities face challenges in achieving meaningful engagement. Barriers such as low accessibility to decision-making platforms, limited public awareness, and fragmented understanding of public sentiment hinder inclusive and data-driven decision-making.

The Consul Democracy platform offers a solution by enabling municipalities to involve citizens in city projects, budgeting, and planning. However, the platform's success relies on understanding how effectively it is being used and how engaged the citizens are.

This project addresses the problem by analyzing the platform‚Äôs content and usage patterns. It provides municipalities with actionable insights to improve project proposals, better involve residents, and understand public sentiment. Ultimately, this analysis benefits both governing bodies and citizens by fostering a more participatory and informed approach to civic decision-making.

## ConsulAnalytics

### About ConsulAnalytics
**Consul Analytics** is an **open-source analytics platform** designed to help municipalities **understand and enhance citizen engagement** on **Consul-powered** platforms.

Many cities use **Consul**, an open-source civic participation tool, to **gather proposals, discussions, and votes** from their residents. However, **municipalities struggle to extract meaningful insights** from this vast amount of data.

That‚Äôs where **Consul Analytics** comes in!

### What We‚Äôve Built
‚úî **Automated Data Scraper** ‚Äì Collects real-time data from multiple Consul-based platforms used by different cities.  
‚úî **User Behavior Insights** ‚Äì Tracks engagement levels, discussion trends, and participation metrics across cities.  
‚úî **Sentiment Analysis** ‚Äì Analyzes public discussions to understand the mood of citizens on various topics.  
‚úî **Trending Topics & Proposals** ‚Äì Identifies the most discussed issues and successful proposals.  
‚úî **Comparative Analysis** ‚Äì Allows municipalities to compare citizen engagement across different cities.

### Why It Matters
Cities **thrive** when they **listen to their citizens**.  
**Consul Analytics** bridges the gap between **raw civic engagement data and actionable insights**, helping policymakers make **better, data-driven decisions**.

üì¢ **With Consul Analytics, municipalities can:**  
- Identify which topics matter most to citizens.  
- Understand how engagement evolves over time.  
- Compare citizen participation between different cities.  
- Improve transparency and accountability in governance.

### Our Impact So Far
‚úî **Analyzed data from 18 cities in Germany**  
‚úî **Processed over 50,000 user interactions**  
‚úî **Provided municipalities with comprehensive user engagement reports**

### Open for Collaboration
As an **open-source project**, we invite **developers, researchers, and municipalities** to join us in expanding **Consul Analytics** and making civic engagement **more transparent, accessible, and impactful.**

üåç **Let's build a smarter, more connected civic future together!** üöÄ

## Scraping Notebook

### About Scraping.ipynb
The `Scraping.ipynb` notebook is designed to extract and organize data from multiple Consul-based platforms used by different cities. It collects data into three main DataFrames:

1. **`all_projects_df`**: Contains all projects from the websites.
   - Columns: `Project URL`, `Project Title`, `Project Description`, `Proposal Count`, `City`

2. **`all_proposals_df`**: Contains all proposals under projects.
   - Columns: `URL`, `Title`, `Proposed for Project`, `Description`, `Author`, `Comments`, `Supporters`, `City`

3. **`all_comments_df`**: Contains all comments under projects and proposals.
   - Columns: `URL`, `Project`, `Text`, `Author`, `Likes`, `Dislikes`, `Date`, `City`

### Key Functions
- **extract_proposals**: Extracts proposals from a project page.
- **extract_city_name**: Extracts the city name from the base URL.
- **scrape_project_page_with_proposals**: Scrapes the project page and extracts the project title, description, and proposals.
- **scrape_projects_with_proposals**: Scrapes the main projects page and extracts the project URLs.
- **scrape_all_comments**: Scrapes all comments from a paginated URL.

### Usage
To run the scraping notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Open the notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Scraping.ipynb
    ```

2. **Run all cells:**
    - This will execute the scraping functions and save the results to CSV files.

3. **Check the output:**
    - The scraped data will be saved in the `data/` directory as `all_projects.csv`, `all_proposals.csv`, and `all_comments.csv`.

## Database Setup

### About the Database
The database for the ConsulDemocracy24 project is designed to store and manage data related to city projects, proposals, and comments. It uses MySQL as the database management system and consists of several tables to organize the data efficiently.

### Database Structure
The database includes the following tables:
- **Cities**: Stores information about different cities.
- **Projects**: Stores information about city projects.
- **Users**: Stores information about users who participate in the platform.
- **Proposals**: Stores information about proposals submitted under projects.
- **Comments**: Stores comments made on projects and proposals.

### Database Schema
Below is a visual representation of the database schema:

![Database Schema](./Database/consuldemocracy_db_scheme.png)

### Setting Up the Database
To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. **Create the database and tables:**
    - Use the provided SQL script `create_database.sql` to create the database and tables.
    - Run the script in your MySQL database management tool.

2. **Input data into the database:**
    - Use the `input_data_to_db.py` script to input data from CSV files into the database.
    - Ensure you have the necessary CSV files (`all_projects.csv`, `all_proposals.csv`, `all_comments.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
